1) Game Development:
write a game development program that implements the Bubble Sort algorithm. The program will simulate a simple game where the player can input a set of numbers, 
and the numbers 	will be sorted using Bubble Sort to simulate a "level-up" scenario where the player's scores 	are sorted in descending order.*/

PROGRAM:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int i,n=10,j,temp=0;
	int score1[n];
	int score2[n];
	
           //Accept score of player1 from user
	cout<<"Enter score for player1:\n";
	for(i=0;i<n;i++){
		cin>>score1[i];
	}

           //Accept score of player2 from user
	cout<<"Enter score for player2:\n";
	for(i=0;i<n;i++){
		cin>>score2[i];
	}

	for(i=0;i<n;i++){
		for(j=0;j<(n-i-1);j++){
			if(score1[j]<score1[j+1])
			{  
				temp = score1[j];
				score1[j] = score1[j+1];
				score1[j+1] = temp;
			}
		}
	}
		cout<<"\nSorted score of Player 1:";
		for(i=0;i<n;i++){
		    cout<<"\n";
			cout<<score1[i];
		}
	for(i=0;i<n;i++){
		for(j=0;j<(n-i-1);j++){
			if(score2[j]<score2[j+1])
			{    
				temp = score2[j];
				score2[j] = score2[j+1];
				score2[j+1] = temp;
			}
		}
	}
		
	cout<<"\nSorted score of Player 2:";
	for(i=0;i<n;i++){
		  cout<<"\n";
		  cout<<score2[i];
	}

           //Calculate and display the result of the game
	if(score1[0]>score2[0]){
		cout<<"\nResult of the game : Player 1 is winner";
	}else{
		cout<<"\nResult of the game: Player 2 is winner";
	}if(score1[0]==score2[0]){
		cout<<"\nResult of the game: Match is tie";
	}
	
	return 0;
}		

2)/*Problem statement:
Organizing Cards in a Hand:
Application: When playing card games, players often use an approach similar to insertion sort to organize their cards. 
They pick one card at a time and insert it into the correct position in their hand, maintaining a sorted sequence.
Write a program that demonstrates how to organize (sort) cards in a hand using insertion sort*/

PROGRAM:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n,temp;
	cout<<"Enter no. of cards:";
	cin>>n;
	int arr[n];
	
	//Accept card numbers
	cout<<"Enter your card numbers:";
	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
		cin>>arr[i];
	}
	
          for(int p=0;p<n-1;p++)       //Passes
	{
		int i=p+1;                //initialization of unsorted array
		int j=i-1;                //Initialization of sorted array
		temp=arr[i];              //shift operation
		
		while(j>=0 && temp<arr[j]){
			arr[j+1]=arr[j];
			j--;
		}
		arr[j+1] = temp;
	 }
	


 //Cards after sorting
 cout<<"\nCards in hand:";
	 
 for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
          cout<<"\n";
          cout<<arr[i];
	}
